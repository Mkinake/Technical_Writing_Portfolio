### Hi there, I am Mangesk kinake 👋

I'm a Analyst Engineer with a passion for crafting quality documentation and learning all things technical writing and Localization-related. 

Here are a few things about me and what I'm doing lately:

✍️ I am a workaholic who loves to create documentation in my free time just for fun! You can check out my [Technical-Writing-Portfolio]() repository to see the technical documents I have produced thus far. 

🌱 I am a lover of learning, and I'm currently learning myself DITA and software technical Writing.

🐙 I recently joined and plan to contribute to the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), an open source community that focuses on developing templates and writing instructions to improve open source software documentation.

⚡ Fun fact: I installed a Little Free Library in my college community as a part of a class project for my Technical Writing I class. I'm very proud of this accomplishment, and it warms my heart to see community members using it. 📚
